About the PNG
=============
PNG file is a PNG + series_of_chunks.

First 8 bytes of any PNG: 137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10
                          ========================
- Says that there is a single PNG image, beginning with an
    1) IHDR chunk
    2) Middle chunks (e.g. IDAT)
    3) IEND chunk

About chunks
============
Each chunk has 4 parts
1) Length: 4-byte unsigned. Specifies how big the DATA PORTION is.
2) Chunk type: 4-byte chunk type code (ASCII only)
3) Chunk data: however long is specified.
4) CRC: 4-bte CRC.
** Chunks cannot be assumed to be aligned to some boundary.
** Chunks can appear in any order.

Deeper into Chunk Types
=======================
Some other stuff about bit 5 of each of the bytes in the 4-byte type.
Most notably is first of the bit-5's in the first byte.
    - If 0, then critical and uppercase.
    - If 1, then ancillary and lowercase (can be skipped if unknown chunk).
** READS LEFT TO RIGHT ==> [Ancillary | Private | Reserved | S2C]

IHDR Chunk (PNG Header)
=======================
The IHDR chunk must appear FIRST.  It contains:
    Width (in pixels):              4 bytes
    Height (in pixels):             4 bytes
    Bit depth:                      1 byte
    Color type:                     1 byte
    Compression method:             1 byte
    Filter method:                  1 byte
    Interlace method:               1 byte

- Bit depth is number of bits per sample (1, 2, 4, 8, 16).
- Color type specifies whether it's grayscale or RGB or RGBA.

IDAT Image Data
===============
To read image data:
1) Decompress using decompression specified by IHDR chunk.
2) De-filter accounding to the filtering method specified in IHDR.
3) Recreate scanlines.

PPM
===
Starts with a magic number most likely P3 or P6
Converts from P6 (raw binary to human readable text P3) : https://thomasebsmith.github.io/ppm-converter/
