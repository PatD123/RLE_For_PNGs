About the PNG
=============
PNG file is a PNG + series_of_chunks.

First 8 bytes of any PNG: 137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10
                          ========================
- Says that there is a single PNG image, beginning with an
    1) IHDR chunk
    2) Middle chunks (e.g. IDAT)
    3) IEND chunk

About chunks
============
Each chunk has 4 parts
1) Length: 4-byte unsigned. Specifies how big the DATA PORTION is.
2) Chunk type: 4-byte chunk type code (ASCII only)
3) Chunk data: however long is specified.
4) CRC: 4-bte CRC.
** Chunks cannot be assumed to be aligned to some boundary.
** Chunks can appear in any order.

Deeper into Chunk Types
=======================
Some other stuff about bit 5 of each of the bytes in the 4-byte type.
Most notably is first of the bit-5's in the first byte.
    - If 0, then critical and uppercase.
    - If 1, then ancillary and lowercase (can be skipped if unknown chunk).
** READS LEFT TO RIGHT ==> [Ancillary | Private | Reserved | S2C]
